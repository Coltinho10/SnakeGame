# SnakeGame

# Introduction

This documentation serves to give you a comprehensive overview of my Snake game. This game is written in Java. Access to a keyboard with directional keys (`UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT`) is needed. 


# Materials

You will need a keyboard with working directional keys to properly play this game. A working internet connection is also needed in order to download the .jar file found in the SnakeGame repository. 


# Installation

1. Navigate to the SnakeGame GitHub page using this [link](https://github.com/Coltinho10/SnakeGame) 

    Click the download code button, then select *Download ZIP*.

3. Double click on the `snakeGame.jar` file to run.


# How to Play

1. Locate the `snakeGame.jar` file and double click on it. This will run the game in a separate window.

2. During play, you will see a white snake and a green apple. Use the directional keys on your keyboard to change the direction of your snake. Run into the apple to increase size. The ultimate objective is to grow your snake as large as possible. 


# Code

This program was written using just four Java classes. Below will be a brief overview of each. 

1. Frame.java includes the main method and constructor. This is how we get the window to appear.

2. Screen.java includes several methods to draw the screen, create the snake and apples, and holds the logic for running and stopping the game. 

3. Body.java contains simple accessors and mutators for the snake body.

4. Food.java is a foil of Body.java for the apples.
